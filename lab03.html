            <h2>Critique</h2>

            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>While the infographic is visually striking, it falls short of what Edward Tufte describes as high
                information
                resolution. Tufte argues that a graphic’s strength lies in its ability to present a high density of
                data, allowing the
                viewer to make comparisons and identify patterns within a single glance. This visualization, however,
                prioritizes
                "beautiful" minimalism over technical depth. The vast purple area is essentially "chartjunk". Which is
                an empty space that conveys
                very little actual data. Because the x-axis only labels three specific years and the y-axis lacks a
                visible scale or
                gridlines, the viewer is unable to determine the values for the fluctuations between 2007 and 2019 and
                makes it very confusing. The resolution is
                further lowered by the use of "million tonnes of oil equivalent," a technical conversion that abstracts
                the physical
                reality of coal burning into a secondary metric, making it harder for a general audience to grasp the
                tangible impact on
                the environment.</p>

            <h3>Effects wihtout Causes</h3>
            <p>The graphic also suffers from presenting effects without causes. The dramatic plunge in coal consumption
                after 2019 is
                presented as a miraculous, self-evident trend, yet the visualization provides no context for the massive
                structural
                shifts that produced this outcome. In reality, this decline was the result of the decommissioning of
                Portugal’s two
                largest coal-fired power plants, Pego and Sines, alongside a significant increase in EU carbon pricing.
                By stripping
                away these causal factors, the graphic suggests an inevitable decline rather than a complex transition
                fueled by
                specific policy decisions and investments in renewable infrastructure. It leaves the user with the
                "what" but completely
                ignores the "how," turning a complex industrial transition into a simple aesthetic slope.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>Furthermore, there is a distinct element of cherry-picking regarding the timeline and the global context
                of the data. By
                ending the primary data set in 2021, the graphic captures a period heavily influenced by the COVID-19
                pandemic, which
                saw a global suppression of industrial energy demand. Presenting this sharp drop without acknowledging
                the temporary
                downward pressure of the pandemic could lead a viewer to believe the transition was smoother or faster
                than the
                long-term structural reality might suggest. Additionally, the visualization blurs the line between
                historical data and
                "projected" outcomes. By merging the two into a single, continuous shaded shape, it risks overreaching,
                lending the same
                level of certainty to future forecasts as it does to verified historical facts.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, this graphic is reaches it's aesthetic goal of modern minalism, but the lacks analytical impact.
                It shows that coal is down, but strips away the resolution needed to understand the complexity of
                Portugal's energy grid. </p>
