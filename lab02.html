            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I explored NotebookLM and Leonardo.AI to understand how specialized AI can assist in
                research synthesis and visual communication within the DCDA field.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 1: NotebookLM</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>NotebookLM excels at "source-grounded" intelligence. It generates summaries and answers based strictly on
                uploaded documents, which significantly reduces hallucinations. However, it struggles with creative
                tasks outside the provided context and cannot interpret complex data visualization within PDFs very
                well.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>It is perfect for synthesizing large amounts of course readings into study guides. It is a poor choice
                for general web searching or news, as its knowledge is limited to your specific "notebook" uploads.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Google claims data uploaded isn't used to train their global models, which protects IP. However, relying
                on it risks creating an intellectual echo chamber by ignoring perspectives not included in the uploaded
                files.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 2: Leonardo.AI</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Leonardo.AI produces high-fidelity visual assets with granular control over style and lighting. It is
                excellent for rapid prototyping but struggles with precise text rendering and maintaining anatomical
                accuracy in complex human poses.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>A good use case is generating concept art or UI backgrounds for digital projects. A poor use case is
                attempting to create photorealistic "news" images, which risks spreading misinformation.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>The tool is trained on vast datasets often without explicit artist consent. While they offer
                "commercially safe" models, the question of attribution for the original artists in the training set
                remains a major concern.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>In a DCDA context, AI shifts the focus from "production" to "curation and auditing." While AI can
                generate the baseline data or images, the human role is to ensure ethical accuracy and cultural
                relevance. When evaluating future tools, I will prioritize transparency in training data and the ability
                to verify outputs against primary sources.</p>
